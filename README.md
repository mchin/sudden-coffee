# Sudden Coffee Subscription Options Feature - Coding Challenge

Currently, Sudden Coffee only offers a single product for subscriptions. Customers have asked for more options around order frequency, quantity, coffee type, etc. We want to create a flow that gives customers options around the coffee they get.

For this challenge, build a basic front-end flow to capture customers preferences (similar to other subscription sites). The flow will allow the customer to answer 3 preference options. At the end of the flow summarize the customerâ€™s order on-screen and send a webrequest to a fake endpoint with the order details.

I used some HTML, CSS, jQuery to create the mockup and AJAX to get the data to send a fake request to the fake server. The page is also  optimized for mobile screens.
